# Def: Abstraction is the ability to ignore the details of parts of a 
## system in order to focus on a higher level.

# Ex: Google Maps

# Modularization: Dividing a whole into well defined parts. You can examine each
## part individually


# Ex: When desinging the previous program/scenario, the act of 
## designing the classes demonstrates modularization.
