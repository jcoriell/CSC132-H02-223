# Def: The software life cycle - a 
# model of how software is developed, used, maintained and discarded
#

# Def: CRC Card - a tool used to organize your 
# thoughts before/during/after programming the software
# Stands for Class, Responsibility, Collaborators

# Bigger Idea: Other tools exist that are similar

# Iterative Development - creating software takes many different iterations. 
# You might develop some features, test those, add more features, break old features, come back
# and fix old features, add on to old features, create new ways to do those old features, 
# add new features, and maybe more... and so

# Documentation - the documentation describes what and why; the code itself says how

# Prototyping - generation of a preliminary model

# Errors
# syntax errors - physical errors like leaving off a colon or not indenting the next line
# logic errors - not found by an interpreter or a compiler; 
#                leads to undesired behavior in the code
# runtime errors - occurs during the execution of the program
# error reporting - passing the error off to a human or somewhere else in the code
# error handling - taking care of errors programatically 
# sanitizing input - ensuring input is the proper type, range, format, etc.
# exceptions - interruptions to the normal flow
# testing - searching for errors
# unit testing - testing a unit separately from everything else
# regression testing - testing previously working code to look for regressions 
#               (to see if it isn't working anymore)
# debugging - finding the source of an error
# manual walkthrough - stepping away from the machine/computer and running through the program
#                by hand
# rubber duck debugging - talking to a rubber duck (or whatever, a wall) to work through
#               your errors

# a debugger - an interactive tool to assist with debugging
# a profiler - a tool that shows you the performance of your program

# refactoring - modifying your code without introducing new features
#           goal is typically to make your code more maintainable
